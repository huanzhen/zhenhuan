## Personal information

Currently I'm an associate professor at [Center for Mathematical Sciences at Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://mathcenter.hust.edu.cn/). I received my PhD from the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://math.illinois.edu/). My advisor was [Charles Rezk](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~rezk//). My dissertation defense was on May 5th, 2016.

I completed my BS in mathematics at [Peking University](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn).

Here is my [CV](Huan-CV.pdf).

## Research

My research interests are in algebraic topology, algebraic geometry and mathematical physics.

## Words to Students who are interested in working with me

I'm interested in (real!) algebraic topology and related area. 

If you want to work with me, you should have

* very strong motivation and passion towards algebraic topology.

* solid background in topology, abstract algebra and basic algebraic topology.

And you should be well-prepared for

* written exams, including topology, abstract algebra, and basic algebraic topology, to see your background.

* an 15-minutes oral exam， to see your background and research abilities.

* a practice: read a relevant paper and present after one week to me.

Then I will determine whether it's a good choice for you to work with me.
